Hi @Christoph-Schuhmann,

Thank you for your interest. Sounds like an interesting idea!

Listing the most important steps off the top of my head here:

    To train on new datasets, you need to adapt your dataloader to the format we use in this repo. Have a look at the data folder and make sure your __getitem__ method is similar to ours.
    Don't forget to add the path to your dataset in utils/mypath.py
    Make config files (similar to the ones in the configs folder) for the pretext and clustering steps. I highly recommend using them.
    Follow the steps in the readme

The same question was asked in issue #8, but if I have more time later I can go into more detail.

Hope this helps for now.
